This repository contains a few silly or less silly Babetrace 2 plugins.

 * Very simple
   [source and sink components](https://github.com/simark/babeltrace-fun-plugins/tree/master/my-first-components),
   to help you get started.
 * A source to read CAN bus traces, implement in both
   [Python](https://github.com/simark/babeltrace-fun-plugins/tree/master/can/python)
   and
   [C(++)](https://github.com/simark/babeltrace-fun-plugins/tree/master/can/c).
 * A source to read
   [gpx](https://github.com/simark/babeltrace-fun-plugins/tree/master/gpx)
   files as traces.
 * A sink to generate
   [plots](https://github.com/simark/babeltrace-fun-plugins/tree/master/plot)
   from event data.
